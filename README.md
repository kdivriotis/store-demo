# Store Demo

This project consists of two web applications, regarding the operation of our food store that's selling crepes. Apart from the physical store where the crepes are being sold, our store provides partnership towards other store owners, who want to include our delicious crepes on their menu.

Through this site, we advertise our store both towards clients and potential partners. The latter have the ability to create an account, which has to be verified by us, the store's owner/administrator. After verifying a partner's account, their store will be displayed on our home page, and they will be able to place orders.

So we need two separate views:

- One for customers/partners to view and/or place their orders
- One for us (the administrator) to view statistics, handle partners and orders, add/edit our available products and create posts (news) to let users know about special offers, products or to welcome our new partners.

Respectively, the two applications placed inside `/user` and `/admin` serve this exact purpose.

If you want to explore the code, see a preview of all available actions and live demos of these sites, visit the respective directories.
