## Live Demo

[Store Demo Administration Panel](https://admin.storedemo.gr)

## Description

This project is the administration panel for our store. This is used to view statistics, creation and editing
of products and posts, handling partners' requests and serving orders. So far, all API calls are directed towards
the [main site](https://www.storedemo.gr), as common file paths & database are being used.
Backend only serves the purpose of serving the frontend React application.

## Technologies Used

Frontend:

- React.js (TypeScript)
- CSS

Backend:

- Node.js (TypeScript)
- Express

Authentication:

- Google ReCaptcha v3
- JSON Web Token (JWT)

## Configuration

In order to run this project, the parameters specified in `.env.example` file need to be specified. After specifying the parameters, rename the file to `.env` as the default configuration file to be used.
The required parameters are:

#### Frontend

- **REACT_APP_API_URL** : The URL of the API to make requests to (e.g. http://localhost:9000)
- **REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_KEY** : The SITE KEY from Google's ReCaptcha. In order to generate a key, a Google account is required. Then, the key can be generated by following [Google's guide](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/).

#### Backend

- **PORT** : The port where the application should be running (e.g. 443 for HTTPS)

## Deploy

The project was developed with Node.js (version 14.18.0) & NPM (version 6.14.15), so these are the minimum prerequisites.

### Run locally

#### Frontend

Navigate inside `frontend` directory, run `npm install` to install all required packages and then run `npm start`. The application will be started on your local machine, at address **localhost:3000**
(or another port if set explicitly or if another application is already using port 3000)

#### Backend

No need to run the backend code.

### Run on hosting provider

#### Frontend

Navigate inside `frontend` directory and run `npm run build` to build the application.
The application is now built inside the `/build` directory.

#### Backend

Navigate inside `backend` directory and run `npm run build` to build the application.
The application is now built inside the `/dist` directory. Copy the `package.json` and `.env` files inside
`/dist` and also create a new directory inside, named `/views`.
Finally, copy the contents of `../frontend/build` inside `/views`.
The content inside `/dist` can now be deployed on a hosting provider that supports **Node.js**.
